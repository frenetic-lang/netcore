Install GHC 7.2.

If you want verification to work, you also need to install Microsoft's Z3
Theorem Prover.  They have an MSI install file for Windows and tarballs for
Linux and Mac at

Be sure to get the correct version for your architecture.  The code expects the
z3 executable (/bin/z3 in the tarball) to be somewhere on the PATH.  Just copy
the file -- no compilation is necessary; the Haskell code communicates with it
as a separate process.
