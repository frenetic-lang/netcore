Frenetic
========

Frenetic is a compiler and runtime system for the NetCore language targeting the
OpenFlow protocol.

We've tested it using the mininet software switch.

Set Up
------
<pre>
cabal configure
cabal build
cabal install
</pre>

If you want verification to work, you also need to install Microsoft's Z3
theorem prover.  They have an MSI install file for Windows and tarballs for
Linux and Mac at

http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/download.html

Be sure to get the correct version for your architecture.  The code expects the
z3 executable (/bin/z3 in the tarball) to be somewhere on the PATH.  Just copy
the file -- no compilation is necessary; the Haskell code communicates with it
as a separate process.
